This is a simple test to measure battery performance on Linux. The test opens and scrolls through Chrome tabs.

The code was executed simultaneously with powerstat (located in the powerstat folder); the measurement consisted of 300 samples taken at one-second intervals. ( the powerstat should be runned manually at the same time, in the powerstat folder, has some measures of my notebook)

While this code was generated by AI and is quite simple, the best measure for battery life remains real-world testing during your daily use.
